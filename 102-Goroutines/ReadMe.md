# Concurrency and Goroutine Examples in Go

This repository contains two examples of using concurrency and goroutines in Go programming language to perform some tasks concurrently.

### Requirements

To run the examples, you need to have Go installed on your machine. You can download and install Go from the official website: https://golang.org/

### Usage

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```
git clone https://github.com/SidharthSasikumar/golang.git
```

Change into the project directory:

```
cd Goroutines
```

Run the following command to compile and run the program:
```
go run goroutines.go
```

This will execute the `goroutines.go` program, which demonstrates how to create a simple goroutine in Go.


`go run goroutines2.go`

This will execute the goroutines2.go program, which demonstrates how to use concurrency and goroutines in Go to perform two tasks concurrently.

Both programs will print some output to the console, demonstrating the behavior of the goroutines.
